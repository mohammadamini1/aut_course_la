Linear Algebra Course Final Project

Project 1: The project involves writing a program that performs various operations on matrices, including finding the adjugate matrix, solving a system of equations using the row echelon method, and determining the null space and rank of a given matrix.

Project 2: This image processing project involves capturing an image and storing it as a matrix. It then performs PCA to analyze variance and correlation, potentially reducing the image's dimensionality. Finally, it generates a new image using the principle component analysis method.
